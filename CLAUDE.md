## What this is

`localharness` is a Rust-native agent SDK for Google's Gemini API
**and** a self-sovereign browser-resident agent platform built on top
of it. One crate; `cargo add` and you have an agent loop with streaming
text, tool calling, hooks, policies, triggers, MCP integration, and
context compaction. Build with the `browser-app` feature on wasm32 and
you also get the live IDE at `<name>.localharness.xyz`.

  (current: **0.10.x**)
- Repo at [github.com/compusophy/localharness](https://github.com/compusophy/localharness)
- Native target: stable Rust 1.85+, tokio-driven
- wasm32 target: same crate compiles to the browser
- Live demo: [`localharness.xyz`](https://localharness.xyz/) —
  marketing apex + wildcard `*.localharness.xyz` for per-user agents
- On-chain registry: EIP-2535 Diamond on Tempo Moderato testnet at
  [`0x6f2858…2930`](https://moderato.tempo.xyz/address/0x6f2858b4b10bf8d4ea372a446e69bea8fbce2930)
  (fresh deploy 2026-05-25; supersedes the previous diamond at
  `0xed7a2d…c656d` which carried abandoned test registrations)

sketched shipped. Anything you need from them is preserved under git

## Build / test / run

```sh
cargo build                                                   # native (default features)
cargo test                                                    # full test suite
cargo check --no-default-features --target wasm32-unknown-unknown  # wasm guardrail
./scripts/build-web.sh                                        # rebuild wasm bundle
vercel deploy --prod --yes                                    # deploy web/
```

## Cargo features

- `native` (default): enables `tokio` multi-thread + process + fs +
  io-util, plus the `walkdir` and `tempfile` deps. Required for
  `run_command` and the MCP stdio bridge, and is what lets the 8 fs
  builtins (list_directory, view_file, find_file, search_directory,
  create_file, edit_file, delete_file, rename_file) register a
  `NativeFilesystem` by default.
- `wallet` (off by default): exposes `pub mod wallet` (secp256k1 +
  BIP-39 + RLP) and `pub mod registry` (JSON-RPC client for the
  Diamond). Pulls in `k256 + sha3 + rand_core + bip39`. Works on
  every target — `sleep_ms` is cfg-gated to `tokio::time::sleep` on
  native, `setTimeout` on wasm.
- `browser-app` (off by default): compiles the `src/app/` module into
  the crate as a wasm cdylib — the browser IDE. Pulls in `maud` for
  HTML templating, `pulldown-cmark` for markdown, plus the `wallet`
  feature transitively. Has no effect on a native build. Built by
  `scripts/build-web.{sh,ps1}` via `wasm-pack build
  --no-default-features --features browser-app`.
- (wasm targets) automatically drop `walkdir`/`tempfile` and add
  `wasm-bindgen-futures`, `uuid/js`, `getrandom/js` via target-cfg.

Library callers on wasm32 who only want the SDK (not the browser app)
depend with `default-features = false` and skip `browser-app`.
Off-bundle consumers (CLI indexers, back-ends) that want to query the
on-chain registry pick `default-features = false, features = ["wallet"]`.

## The wasm story (M2.5)

The crate compiles to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` because:

- `src/runtime.rs::spawn` cfg-gates `tokio::spawn` (native) vs.
  `wasm_bindgen_futures::spawn_local` (wasm).
- `src/runtime.rs::MaybeSendSync` is `Send + Sync` on native and
  empty on wasm. Every trait that used to require `: Send + Sync`
  now requires `: MaybeSendSync`.
- Every `#[async_trait]` is `cfg_attr`'d to use `?Send` on wasm so
  browser-fetch futures (which aren't `Send`) can satisfy the trait
  method signatures.
- `Connection::subscribe_steps` returns a `StepStream` type alias
  that maps to `BoxStream` (native) or `LocalBoxStream` (wasm).
- `JoinHandle` storage and abort logic is cfg-gated; on wasm we
  fire-and-forget via `spawn_local`.
- Tools that need OS primitives are gated behind `feature = "native"`:
  the 8 fs builtins (list/view/find/search/create/edit/delete/rename),
  `run_command`, MCP. The 4 portable ones (`ask_question`, `finish`,
  `generate_image`, `start_subagent`) work on both targets.

When adding new traits or `tokio::spawn` calls, mirror these patterns
or wasm will break silently (the gated modules don't trip in a default
`cargo check`).

## Common gotchas

- **Gemini model IDs flip — verify against the live API, never trust
  memory.** `DEFAULT_MODEL` is `gemini-3.5-flash` (as of 2026-05-29).
  `gemini-2.5-flash` now 400s; in the 0.10.x era it was the reverse.
  Before changing/defending a model constant, `curl` the live
  `:generateContent` endpoint. If the user says a model is wrong, TEST
  THEIRS FIRST.
- **Gemini rejects union-type tool schemas with a 400 — it bricks ALL
  chat.** Function-declaration `input_schema` must use a single `type`
  (NOT `["string","null"]`), and no `additionalProperties` / `$schema` /
  `$ref` / `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`. `configure_agent` shipped a union
  type and 400'd every turn. Guard: `cargo test
  builtin_tool_schemas_have_no_union_types` (backends/gemini/tools/mod.rs)
  lints every builtin schema, network-free. `minimum`/`maximum`/nested
  objects+arrays are fine.
- **PowerShell 5.1 stderr trap.** `release.ps1` wraps native commands
  in `Invoke-Native` because PS5 turns every cargo stderr line into a
  terminating error. Don't call `cargo`/`git`/`gh` directly inside
  the script.
- **Gemini 3.x `thought: false` parts.** The wire `Part` enum is
  untagged; `Part::Thought { thought: bool, .. }` is declared
  *before* `Part::Text { text }`. Gemini 3.x stamps every part with a
  `thought` field, so a normal text part deserializes into
  `Part::Thought { thought: false, text: Some(...), .. }`. Consumers
  must handle that variant explicitly.
- **SSE on wasm uses CRLF.** Browser fetch surfaces Gemini's SSE
  with `\r\n\r\n` frame separators. `GeminiSseStream::take_frame`
  now matches both `\n\n` and `\r\n\r\n`. Don't regress to LF-only.
- **`max-age=immutable` on `/pkg/*` was a footgun.** `vercel.json`
  uses `max-age=0, must-revalidate` so redeploys actually take effect
  without forcing a hard-reload. Add a version query string before
  re-enabling long caching.
- **The release script only commits `Cargo.toml` + `Cargo.lock` +
  `CHANGELOG.md`.** Anything else that needs to ship in a release
  must be committed *before* invoking the script. See RELEASING.md.

## Release process

```sh
# 1. Land all the feature work as normal commits.
# 2. Edit CHANGELOG.md - add `## [X.Y.Z]` heading (no date - script adds).
# 3. Run the atomic release script.
./scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z          # bash / git-bash
pwsh scripts/release.ps1 -Version X.Y.Z   # PowerShell on Windows
```

The script does pre-flight checks → version bump → cargo verify →
commit → tag → push → cargo publish → GH release in one shot. If it
fails mid-way, consult the recovery table in `RELEASING.md`; don't
hand-fix.

## The browser app

Compiled into the crate as `src/app/`, gated on `feature = "browser-app"`
plus `target_arch = "wasm32"`. Module list in the repo-layout block
above; the per-module summaries below cover the load-bearing pieces.

**Design rule: no imperative DOM manipulation.** All HTML comes from
`maud` templates; the only DOM operations are `set_inner_html` /
`set_outer_html` / `insert_adjacent_html` targeted at fixed element
ids (HTMX-style fragment swaps). One delegated `click` listener, one
`keydown`, one `submit`, one `input` listener at the document level
handle every interaction by reading `data-action` and `data-arg`
attributes off the event target's ancestor chain. There are zero
`Closure::wrap` calls outside of those four listeners.

Mount-time routing in `mod.rs::mount`:

1. If `?signer=1` → render minimal signer chrome, install
   postMessage listener (`signer::install_signer_listener`), return.
   The tab is now a cross-origin signing service. If no wallet has
   been created at the apex origin yet, `paint_signer` renders the
   `signer_no_identity` chrome and `signer::build_response` errors
   on every challenge — we never silently generate a wallet here.
2. Else, classify hostname via `tenant::current()`:
   - `Host::Apex` (`localharness.xyz`) → identity-gated apex chrome.
     `paint_apex` calls `wallet_store::load()` (never creates) — fresh
     visitors see the `identity_sidecar` with `[Create identity]` +
     `[Import existing seed]`, and the claim form is rendered with
     `disabled` input + submit. Wallet creation only happens via the
     explicit `Action::CreateIdentity` or `Action::ImportSeed`
     dispatch paths, both of which re-run `paint_apex` so the form
     unlocks and the "your agents" list fetches in the background.
   - `Host::Tenant(name)` → check `.lh_owner` marker:
     - Missing + `?claim=1` → auto-claim, paint full app.
     - Missing + no hint → paint "claim this name" prompt.
     - Present → paint full chat app.
     Then `kick_verification` runs in the background: queries
     on-chain owner via `registry::owner_of_name`, runs
     `verify::verify_owner` (iframe sign challenge), updates the
     `#verify-pill` and (if visitor) swaps `#input-region` for a
     read-only banner. Also fetches `tba_of_name` for the 💰 pill.
   - `Host::Other` (Vercel preview, localhost) → paint full chat
     app, no verification.

   **Two surfaces per subdomain (public face vs studio).** Every
   subdomain has a visitor-facing **public face** (a fullscreen
   cartridge) and an owner-only **studio** (the workshop chrome). Routing
   is role-based, keyed on `owner.is_some()` (this device's local
   ownership claim, refined later by verification):
   - **Owner** → lands in the **studio** by default. Never auto-hijacked
     into a fullscreen app. Previews the public face via `?view=public`
     (a `[view public]` link in the tenant header), which paints the
     fullscreen cartridge with a `[studio]` escape link (→ `?edit=1`).
   - **Visitor** → only ever sees the **public face**. No studio, no edit
     door.
   `try_paint_app(name, owner_overlay)` paints the public face: local
   `app.rl` working copy first, else the on-chain published wasm
   (`templates::app_fullscreen(owner_overlay)` + a `<canvas>` run via
   `display::run_in_root_canvas`). `owner_overlay` gates the `[studio]`
   link (set only when the owner is previewing). When NO cartridge is
   published, `paint_public_landing` renders the **default public face**
   (`templates::public_landing`): a profile/directory landing — the
   agent's name, its owner (the MAIN name when it differs), its TBA
   wallet, and a directory of the owner's other agents (siblings via
   `registry::list_owned_tokens`, self excluded). A visitor never falls
   through to the studio chrome anymore.

   **Second-device owner upgrade.** A seed-bearing owner hitting their
   own subdomain from a device WITHOUT the local `.lh_owner` marker is
   treated as a visitor (lands on the public face). `paint_tenant` then
   fires `redirect_to_studio_if_owner` in the background: if
   `verify::verify_owner` proves control via the apex signer, it
   navigates to `?edit=1` (the studio). Skipped when the device already
   claims ownership, so a deliberate `?view=public` preview never bounces. The agent makes a
   subdomain "become" an app by writing the same source it passes to
   `run_cartridge` to `app.rl` via `create_file` — but only on an
   explicit "make this my permanent app" request. (Earlier a MAIN was
   hard-blocked from fullscreen; that special-case was dropped once the
   owner always lands in the studio — the guarantee now comes from
   role-based routing, not a per-name exception.)

   **Cross-visitor publishing (on-chain).** Local `app.rl` is the
   owner-device copy; for *visitors* `try_paint_app` falls back to the
   on-chain published wasm. The compiled cartridge bytes are stored in
   the registry diamond under `metadata(tokenId, keccak256(
   "localharness.app.wasm"))` — no new facet, the existing owner-gated
   `setMetadata(uint256,bytes32,bytes)` holds it. The owner publishes
   via the **admin → app → "publish app on-chain"** button
   (`events::run_publish_app`), which compiles the local `app.rl` and
   submits a sponsored `setMetadata` Tempo tx (owner signs the
   sender_hash through the apex iframe; sponsor pays). `registry::
   app_wasm_of` reads it back. So once published, every visitor boots
   into the cartridge, not just the owner's device.

**Identity-gate invariant.** `wallet_store::load_or_create` no longer
exists. The two callers are `wallet_store::load()` (pure read,
returns `Option<MasterWallet>`) and `wallet_store::create_and_persist()`
(generates + writes, only invoked from `Action::CreateIdentity`).
Don't reintroduce a load-or-create helper — silent wallet generation
on a marketing-page visit was the bug the gate fixes.

Build: `wasm-pack build . --target web --out-dir web/pkg --release
--no-default-features --features browser-app`. wasm-opt is disabled in
`[package.metadata.wasm-pack.profile.release]` because the wasm-pack-
bundled wasm-opt rejects post-MVP features that modern rustc emits.

## The on-chain stack

The registry lives at one address forever — the diamond proxy at
`0x6f2858b4b10bf8d4ea372a446e69bea8fbce2930` on Tempo Moderato
testnet (chain id 42431, RPC `https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz`).
(Predecessor diamond at `0xed7a2d…c656d` carried abandoned test
registrations and is no longer referenced by the bundle.)
Facets are added/removed via `diamondCut`; the wasm bundle's
`registry::REGISTRY_ADDRESS` constant doesn't change.

Currently cut in:

- **DiamondCutFacet** — owner-only `diamondCut(...)` (upgrades).
- **DiamondLoupeFacet** — introspection + `supportsInterface`.
- **OwnershipFacet** — EIP-173 `owner()` + `transferOwnership`.
- **LocalharnessRegistryFacet** — `register / ownerOfName /
  ownerOfId / idOfName / nameOfId / idOf / setMetadata / nextId /
  metadata / isTaken`. Mints emit `Transfer(0, owner, tokenId)` so
  the ERC-721 facet stays consistent.
- **ERC721Facet** — full ERC-721 + Metadata. Every name is an NFT.
  `tokenURI(id)` → `https://<name>.localharness.xyz/`.
- **TbaFacet** — wraps EIP-6551. `tokenBoundAccount(id)` and
  `tokenBoundAccountByName(name)` return the deterministic
  counterfactual account address. `createTokenBoundAccount(id)`
  actually deploys it (anyone can call, idempotent).
- **Gemini key sync (per-MAIN, on-chain).** The sealed Gemini API key
  lives under the owner's **MAIN tokenId** (`mainOf(owner)`, falling back
  to the name's own id), NOT per-subdomain — so every subdomain an owner
  holds shares ONE key ("the subdomain IS the primary owner"). On a
  tenant paint, `events::try_auto_restore_gemini_key` fetches that blob
  and decrypts it via the apex iframe (`open_key_via_iframe`, seed-derived
  key) BEFORE the api-key modal would show, so a new subdomain on any
  seed-bearing device never re-prompts. Saving a key
  (`save_api_key_pressed`) best-effort `auto_sync_gemini_key`s it to the
  MAIN slot. Slot resolver: `events::gemini_key_slot_id`. NOTE: a phone
  linked by *device key only* (pairing, no seed) can't decrypt the
  seed-sealed blob, so it gets an **ECIES-wrapped-to-device** copy
  instead (built): on pairing the phone announces its compressed pubkey
  (`PairingAnnounced(bytes32,address,bytes,uint256)`), the desktop reads
  the MAIN's seed-sealed key, decrypts with the local seed, re-wraps it
  to the device pubkey via `encryption::ecies_seal` (ephemeral k256 ECDH
  → keccak → AES-GCM; `wallet::{pubkey_compressed,ephemeral_keypair,
  ecdh_shared_key}`), and posts the blob under
  `keccak256("localharness.gemini_key.dev."||device_addr)` on the MAIN
  tokenId (`registry::set_device_wrapped_key_sponsored`). The phone polls
  `wrapped_device_key_of`, decrypts with its device key
  (`ecies_open`), and saves locally — never touching the seed. Needs the
  k256 `ecdh` feature. v2 pairing facet adds the
  `announcePairing(bytes32,bytes)` selector (old `(bytes32)` left as a
  harmless orphan).
- **PairingFacet** — `announcePairing(bytes32 codeHash)` emits
  `PairingAnnounced(bytes32 indexed codeHash, address indexed device,
  uint256 timestamp)`. Event-only, no storage (like Feedback). Powers
  zero-copy device linking: the desktop (master wallet) shows a one-time
  code; the phone opens `<name>.localharness.xyz/?pair=CODE`, generates a
  fresh device key, and calls `announcePairing(keccak256(code))` as a
  SPONSORED tempo tx (so its device key is `msg.sender`, pays nothing).
  The desktop filters logs by that codeHash topic, learns the device
  address from the indexed `device` topic, and enrolls it via
  `addSigner` on the TBA — no 0x ever copied between machines. Two-way
  challenge: the Tempo sender sig proves device-key control; knowing the
  code proves co-presence. Facet at `0x316a80b6eeCd0797a89f6D16c03C0ce260d2A64d`
  (cut 2026-05-29 via `script/AddPairingFacet.s.sol`); device key stored
  per-tenant-origin in `.lh_device_key` (raw hex, NOT the master seed).
- **FeedbackFacet** — `submitFeedback(string text)` emits
  `FeedbackSubmitted(address sender, uint256 timestamp, string text)`.
  No storage, just events; harvest off-chain via `cast logs` (see
  `scripts/harvest-feedback.{sh,ps1}`). Anyone can submit; gas IS the
  spam filter. 2048-byte upper bound on text.
- **MainIdentityFacet** — `registerMain(uint256) / clearMain() /
  mainOf(address) / mainNameOf(address) / isMain(uint256)`. Records
  which of a holder's subdomain NFTs is their primary identity. No
  fee yet (sybil-resistance layer is later). Auto-set by the bundle
  on first-claim. See `design/main-identity.md`.
- **LocalharnessRegistryFacet (cost-gated)** — `register(name)` can
  pull `registrationCost()` LH from the caller into the diamond via
  `transferFrom` (caller must approve the diamond first; bundle
  batches `approve` + `register` in one Tempo tx). Owner-only
  `setRegistrationCost(uint256)` knob; zero disables. **Currently set
  to 0 (registration is FREE / ungated)** — set to 0 on 2026-05-28
  because the daily-claim onboarding was broken and new users had no
  LH to pay the old 50 LH cost; the bundle's `cost == 0` branch then
  registers with no approve/claim. The credit token + `CreditsFacet`
  stay on-chain for the future (streaming/subscription model), but the
  daily-claim UI was removed from the bundle. Re-cut on 2026-05-26 via
  `script/SwapRegistryFacetAddCost.s.sol`; cost-gate storage at
  `keccak256("localharness.registration_cost.storage.v1")`.
- **CreditsFacet** — distribution layer for the `LocalharnessCredits`
  TIP-20-shaped credit token. Surface: `claimDaily() / canClaim(addr)
  / dailyAllowance() / lastClaimDay(addr) / creditsToken()`. Owner-
  only setters: `setCreditsToken(addr) / setDailyAllowance(amount)`.
  Diamond holds `ISSUER_ROLE` on the token, so `claimDaily` is the
  only path to fresh supply. Day boundary = `block.timestamp / 86400`
  (UTC-aligned, no cron). See `contracts/src/LocalharnessCredits.sol`
  for the token's TIP-20 surface (currency = "credits", not USD —
  explicitly NOT fee-token-eligible).

ERC-6551 reference contracts (separate addresses, configured via
`TbaFacet::setTbaConfig`):
- Registry: `0xc7cadc487eeb06fe8807104443b2f76b45c041d6`
- Account impl: `0x26947dF2029633Ee32532221CA7C6a2A56f8d1aF`
  (`MultiSignerAccount` — CALL-only; an additional-signer set on top of
  the NFT holder + EIP-1271 `isValidSignature`, so a MAIN can be
  controlled by multiple device EOAs without sharing the seed.
  **Hardened 2026-05-29** (0.14.0 security pass): signer management is
  owner-only and additional signers are bound to the enrolling holder
  (`_signerEnroller[signer] == owner()`), so an NFT transfer silently
  revokes the prior holder's device signers; `isValidSignature` rejects
  high-s (EIP-2). Re-deployed + repointed via
  `script/SwapTbaImplToMultiSigner.s.sol` on 2026-05-29; the prior
  `MultiSignerAccount` at `0x100967d751C97265F3ee93244fAeE8caf29cB48D`
  (and the older `ERC6551Account` at `0x8ad49e86…d7f4`) are no longer
  referenced — TBAs minted under them resolve to different
  counterfactual addresses than current mints. The bundle reads TBA
  addresses via the diamond's `tokenBoundAccount`, so no bundle change
  was needed.)

Adding a new facet: write `LibXyzStorage` at a fresh
`keccak256("localharness.xyz.storage.v1")` slot, write the facet,
forge build, write a one-off cut script following `AddTbaFacet.s.sol`
as a template, deploy. See `contracts/README.md` for the full
walkthrough.

## Tempo Transactions + sponsorship (post-0.10.24)

The user-facing claim flow uses Tempo's **native** account-abstraction
tx type (`0x76`) so users hold ZERO of anything — no native gas, no
TIP-20 stablecoin, nothing. The bundle's `src/app/sponsor.rs`
signs as `fee_payer` and pays fees in AlphaUSD on every user tx.

### Wire format (live-verified — see `[[tempo-tx-findings]]`)

```text
0x76 || rlp([
    chain_id, mpfpg, mfpg, gas_limit,
    calls,                // [[to, value, input], ...]
    access_list,          // EIP-2930
    nonce_key, nonce,     // Tempo's 2D nonce
    valid_before, valid_after,
    fee_token,            // 0x80 (empty) in sender hash if sponsored
    fee_payer_signature,  // 0x00 placeholder in sender hash; 0x80 or
                          // rlp([v,r,s]) in serialized tx
    aa_authorization_list,
    key_authorization?,   // truly optional; omit when None
    sender_signature      // flat 65 bytes (r||s||v with v=0/1)
])
```

Sender hash: `keccak256(0x76 || rlp([1..14_without_sender_sig]))`.
Fee-payer hash: `keccak256(0x78 || rlp([1..10, fee_token,
sender_address, aa_authorization_list, key_authorization?]))`. The
spec page is missing `aa_authorization_list` at position 13 of the
fee_payer hash — discovered by diffing against `wevm/ox`'s
`TxEnvelopeTempo`. Captured in memory so we don't relearn.

### $LH is TIP-20-shaped credit, NOT fee-token-eligible

Tempo's `fee_token` validation requires TIP-20 compliance AND
`currency() == "USD"`. Our `LocalharnessCredits` at
`0xC1FC0452670049953ED64f2B177beBed4090A5bc` (deployed 2026-05-26,
replaces the old vanilla ERC-20 at `0xcC8A300658…`) implements the
TIP-20 surface — memo transfers, supply cap, roles — but returns
`currency() == "credits"`, so the chain explicitly rejects it as a
fee_token. That's intentional: $LH is in-system credits, not gas.
**AlphaUSD** (`0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001`) remains
the sponsor's fee_token. $LH supply is controlled — the diamond
holds `ISSUER_ROLE`, and the only mint path is
`CreditsFacet.claimDaily()` (one claim per address per UTC day,
amount set by `setDailyAllowance` owner-only). Old token at
`0xcC8A300658…` is orphaned; balances do not migrate.

### Sponsor key

Lives in `src/app/sponsor.rs` as a const. Same address as the
deployer for now (testnet acceptable). **Rotate before mainnet** —
either to a dedicated low-budget sponsor wallet (small extraction
blast radius) or to a different key-management scheme entirely
(WebAuthn passkey per user, Stripe-backed top-up, etc.). Tempo
access keys CANNOT sign as `fee_payer` — confirmed by reading
their open-source SDK, see `[[access-key-fee-payer-finding]]`. The
fee_payer signature must come from the root key directly.

### Migration status

| Flow | Path | State |
|------|------|-------|
| Apex first-claim (`run_apex_claim`) | sponsored tempo tx | ✅ |
| Tenant first-claim (`signer.rs::run_claim_name`) | sponsored tempo tx via iframe | ✅ |
| `claim_and_maybe_set_main_sponsored` | tempo tx batch | ✅ |
| `lh_transfer` | `run_sponsored_tempo_call` (sender_hash via iframe) | ✅ |
| `submit_feedback` | `run_sponsored_tempo_call` | ✅ |
| publish app (`setMetadata`) | `run_sponsored_tempo_call` | ✅ |
| add/remove device signer | `add_/remove_signer_sponsored` | ✅ |
| `register_main_sponsored` | sponsored tempo tx | ✅ |

The migration is complete: the iframe signer's `lh-sign-digest`
message (the tenant computes the sender_hash, the apex wallet signs it,
the embedded sponsor signs `fee_payer`) is the shared mechanism. Every
user-facing write goes through `events::run_sponsored_tempo_call`, so
users hold zero of anything. The self-paid `sign_and_submit_call` /
standalone `register_main` paths remain in `registry.rs` for off-bundle
/ native callers but aren't used by the browser UI.

## What's planned

The SDK runtime (0.2.x–0.6.x) and the in-tree browser IDE (0.7.x)
shipped. The platform layer (subdomains + master wallet + on-chain
registry + ERC-721 NFTs + ERC-6551 token-bound wallets + iframe
signer + visitor lockdown) shipped through 0.10.0. The Tempo native
AA migration shipped post-0.10.24. What's next:

- **MPP / x402 payment hooks.** A pre-tool-call hook that requires
  a payment to the agent's TBA before the LLM call executes, or an
  agent-pays-agent flow over Stripe's MPP (preferred per user) or
  Coinbase's x402. Either fits behind the existing `Hook` trait;
  the on-chain plumbing exists already.
- **ERC-8004 reputation + validation facets.** Cut into the diamond
  alongside the existing registry facets. Lets agents accrue
  reputation that other agents can read; validators stake to
  re-execute claims.
- **TBA-driven actions in the bundle.** UX for "let your agent send
  this transaction from its TBA" — the master wallet signs a
  TBA.execute payload, the bundle wires the RPC. Mostly a UI piece;
  the contract surface is ready.
- **Second backend** (Anthropic, OpenAI, or local). The
  `Connection` / `ConnectionStrategy` abstractions are in place;
  validating them with a non-Gemini implementation is overdue.
- **Tool-call activity in restored transcripts.** `TranscriptEntry`
  drops FunctionCall / FunctionResponse on replay today — the
  agent's context is correct but the user can't see prior tool use.
- **At-rest encryption.** Wallet-derived sym key over OPFS contents
  so XSS-equivalent attacks on origins can't trivially exfiltrate.

## Filesystem trait

The 8 fs-shaped builtins (`list_directory`, `view_file`, `find_file`,
`search_directory`, `create_file`, `edit_file`, `delete_file`,
`rename_file`) call into `crate::filesystem::Filesystem` instead of
`tokio::fs` directly. The trait surface:

- `read`, `write_atomic`, `metadata`, `read_dir`, `walk`, `delete`,
  `rename` (default impl is read + write + delete; NativeFilesystem
  overrides with `tokio::fs::rename` for atomicity)

Two implementations ship:

- **`NativeFilesystem`** (gated on `feature = "native"`): `tokio::fs`
  + `walkdir` + `tempfile`; atomicity via tempfile + rename.
- **`OpfsFilesystem`** (wasm32 only): Origin Private File System via
  `web-sys`; atomicity via `FileSystemWritableFileStream.close()` swap.

`GeminiConnectionStrategy::connect` honors a caller-supplied
`Filesystem` via `with_filesystem`, otherwise auto-installs
`NativeFilesystem` on native (or `None` on wasm, where the caller is
expected to supply OPFS — the browser app does so). Plug-in impls
(mocks for tests, custom backends) implement the trait and hand a
`SharedFilesystem = Arc<dyn Filesystem>` via the builder.

## Documentation SOP

Five documentation surfaces; keep them in sync on every change.

| Surface | File | Audience | What it covers |
|---------|------|----------|----------------|
| **docs.rs** | `///` comments in source | SDK consumers | Public API: every `pub` item needs a one-liner |
| **README.md** | repo root | GitHub visitors, crates.io | Quick start, features, architecture, links |
| **CLAUDE.md** | repo root | Claude Code sessions | Full internal context: repo layout, gotchas, plans |
| **llms.txt** | `web/llms.txt` | External agents, LLMs | Agent capabilities, RPC format, on-chain registry |
| **CHANGELOG.md** | repo root | Users tracking releases | Per-version changes (Keep-a-Changelog) |

### When to update what

- **New pub API item** → add `///` doc comment (one-liner) + update
  README if it changes the feature surface.
- **New file or module** → update CLAUDE.md repo layout tree.
- **New agent capability / tool** → update `llms.txt` tool list +
  `chat.rs::start_session` system prompt.
- **New on-chain facet or contract** → update CLAUDE.md on-chain
  section + `llms.txt` registry section.
- **Browser app UX change** → update CLAUDE.md browser app section.
- **Release** → CHANGELOG.md entry (the release script stamps the
  date). README version badge auto-updates from crates.io.

### Single source of truth rules

- **Code comments** are truth for API behaviour → docs.rs renders
  them. Don't duplicate API docs in README.
- **CLAUDE.md** is truth for internal architecture → don't duplicate
  in README or llms.txt.
- **llms.txt** is truth for agent-facing capabilities → keep it
  concise, machine-readable, no marketing.
- **System prompt** in `chat.rs::start_session` is truth for what
  the agent knows about itself → update when tools change.

### Verification

Before any release:
```sh
cargo doc --no-deps 2>&1 | grep "warning.*missing"  # catch undocumented pub items
curl -s https://localharness.xyz/llms.txt | head -5  # verify llms.txt deployed
```
