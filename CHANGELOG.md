## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0-alpha.2] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- **Tool calling end-to-end** through the Gemini backend. The agent
  loop now drives a model ↔ tool dispatch loop: streams the response,
  collects `functionCall` parts, routes each through hooks → policies →
  `ToolRunner`, appends `functionResponse` parts to history, and
  continues until the model produces no more function calls (or hits
  the 16-round safety cap).
- **Five read-only built-in tools** under `backends::gemini::tools`:
  - `list_directory(path)` — sorted children with name/kind/size.
  - `view_file(path, start_line?, end_line?)` — 1-indexed inclusive
    range, 256 KiB truncation cap, UTF-8 lossy.
  - `find_file(path, pattern, max_depth?)` — glob-matched recursive
    file search, 1000-match cap.
  - `search_directory(path, pattern, file_glob?, case_sensitive?)` —
    regex content search, 500-match / 4 MiB-per-file cap.
  - `finish(output?)` — terminates the turn; captures structured
    output when the agent is configured with a response schema.
- `tools::ToolRunner::iter_tools()` — snapshot every registered tool
  for `FunctionDeclaration` construction.
- `GeminiBackendConfig::with_capabilities` and `GeminiAgentConfig`
  routes built-in selection through `CapabilitiesConfig::effective_tools`.
- Built-in tools are auto-registered into the `ToolRunner` at connect
  time per the capability list. User-registered tools of the same name
  win (no overwrite).
- Unit tests for `list_directory`, `view_file` against the real
  filesystem.

### Changed

- `Agent::start_local` / `start_gemini` now go through
  `start_with_factory<S, F>` so backends can opt into runner injection.
  The Gemini strategy uses this to dispatch function calls inline.
- The agent loop emits `Step { kind: ToolCall, target: Environment }`
  events when dispatching, so `ChatResponse::tool_calls()` lights up.
- `walkdir`, `globset`, `regex` added as deps (built-ins only).

## [0.2.0-alpha.1] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- **`Agent::start_gemini(GeminiAgentConfig)`** — Rust-native Gemini
  backend. Talks to the Gemini REST API directly via `reqwest`; no Go
  binary, no Python install, no external process. This is Phase 1 of
  the 0.2.x runtime per `DESIGN.md`.
- `backends::gemini::{GeminiBackendConfig, GeminiConnectionStrategy,
  GeminiConnection}` — public API for the new backend.
- `backends::gemini::api::GeminiClient` — async client over `reqwest`
  with API-key redaction in `Debug`. Includes a small SSE decoder
  (`GeminiSseStream`) that handles partial chunks and `[DONE]` terminators.
- `backends::gemini::wire::*` — `serde` types matching the Gemini REST
  contract (camelCase verbatim). Round-trip tests cover text, thought,
  and `functionCall` part shapes.
- `backends::gemini::loop::run_turn` — the agent loop. Streams text and
  thought deltas, accumulates the assistant turn into history, emits a
  terminal `Step`. Phase 1 is text-only; tool calls land in Phase 2.
- `examples/text_chat.rs` — end-to-end example against `GEMINI_API_KEY`:
  streams tokens, prints usage summary.

### Changed

- `ChatResponse::text_stream()`, `thoughts()`, `tool_calls()` now return
  `BoxStream<...>` so callers can iterate with `.next().await` without
  needing to `Box::pin` themselves.
- `Agent::start_local`/`start_gemini` share a single
  `start_with_strategy` bootstrap — every future backend gets the same
  hook/tool/policy wiring for free.

### Deprecated

- `Agent::start_local` and the entire 0.1.x `LocalConnection`
  (Go-binary-backed) backend. Will be removed in 0.3.0.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- Rewrote `README.md` as a full crate landing page: hero example,
  collapsible feature tour (streaming, dual-cursor, custom tools,
  policies, workspace, triggers, multimodal, resume), ASCII
  architecture diagrams, design-notes section, comparison table
  vs the Python SDK, and FAQ.

### Added

- `RELEASING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `scripts/release.{sh,ps1}`
  define a one-command atomic release process.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Initial Rust port of the [`google-antigravity`][upstream] Python SDK,
  pinned to upstream commit
  [`d6be9ca`](https://github.com/google-antigravity/antigravity-sdk-python/commit/d6be9ca).
- **`Agent`** (Layer 1) — builder-style config, write-tool safety check,
  background dispatcher routing custom tool calls through
  hooks → policies → `ToolRunner` → `send_tool_results`.
- **`Conversation` + `ChatResponse`** (Layer 2) — stateful session with
  multi-cursor lazy stream (replay-from-zero per cursor). Filtered
  cursors: `text_stream`, `thoughts`, `tool_calls`. Per-turn usage,
  cumulative usage, structured output extraction.
- **`Connection` + `LocalConnection`** (Layer 3) — transport over the
  `localharness` binary. `AtomicBool` for idle, `tokio::sync::broadcast`
  for step fan-out, bounded `mpsc` inbox (cap 16), single
  `tokio::select!` supervisor, separate process supervisor with
  `kill_on_drop`. 10 s handshake timeout.
- **Hook system** — six trait kinds (session start/end, pre/post turn,
  pre/post tool call) with hierarchical `HookContext`.
- **Policy engine** — Python-matching precedence (specific deny ≻
  specific ask ≻ specific allow ≻ wildcard deny ≻ wildcard ask ≻
  wildcard allow), `enforce()` adapter, `workspace_only()` with
  component-wise path containment (defeats `/foo/bar-evil` vs
  `/foo/bar` prefix tricks).
- **`ToolRunner`** — lock-free context swap via `arc_swap`, `ClosureTool`
  builder for ad-hoc tools.
- **`TriggerRunner`** — `every()` helper, abort-on-drop,
  `TriggerDelivery` semantics.
- **Multimodal input** — `Content` / `Part` / `Media` with `from_path()`
  MIME inference; `Bytes`-backed payloads (refcounted, zero-copy clones).
- **Typed errors** — flat `thiserror` enum; `io::Error`,
  `serde_json::Error`, `prost` errors fold via `#[from]`.
- **Smoke example** (`cargo run --example smoke`) — end-to-end against a
  stubbed `Connection`.
- **Upstream sync infrastructure** — `UPSTREAM.md` pins commit;
  `scripts/sync-upstream.{sh,ps1}` diff against pin without modifying
  the working tree.
